# Tools
Here's a few useful tools:
- [EarthBound Window Register Address Calculator](earthbound-window-address.html)
  - This useful tool will tell you what address in memory you can find the given entries:
    - Existence table entry, which maps a window number (ex. 14 for main battle window)
      to a window stats entry.
    - Window stats entry, which contains all the register information for a given window.
- [Triangle solver given aspect ratio and hypotenuse length](triangle-solver.html)
  - Sometimes you just need to know the width and height of a 24" 16x9 monitor (or whatever size/aspect ratio)
