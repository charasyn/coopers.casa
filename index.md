# Main page
Hello! This is my website. It's a WIP and hopefully some neat things will be up here soon!

## Me
I go by many names:
- Cooper Harasyn
- charasyn
- cooprocks123e

I like the following things:
- Retro video games
- Low-level coding (Assembly/C)
- Hacking/exploitation of systems

As the perfect intersection of these three, [see this collaboration I did with SethBling a few years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixu8tn__91E).

## What kinds of things?
Many things! Small technical articles, useful calculators, gadgets, and other tiny apps, etc...
